### Reimagining quality care.: 

From the beginning, our mission has remained unchanged: to help all people live longer, healthier and happier lives.



### Where it all started.:
etting transportation and food delivery by phone is easy. So why are patients still packed into waiting rooms to see their doctor?”

### How It all Started?:
With that bit of wisdom, Dr. James Wantuck and Ryan McQuaid started PlushCare — a doctor’s office on your phone or computer. Ryan had spent plenty of time waiting around for doctors, and James, as a doctor himself, knew how clogged the healthcare system was.


Ironically, the first PlushCare headquarters was in the back room of a doctor’s office in San Francisco. Dr. Wantuck saw patients via video, while Ryan manned the phones and booked appointments.


Today, our team of 100+ physicians and employees no longer fits in the back of a doctor’s office, but our mission is unchanged: to help everyone live a longer, healthier and happier life.
